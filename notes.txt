----------
Yanhong Shi, April Shu
Deadline: June 13th
Alzheimer's disease brain organoids
Program officer wants a specific aims page
Need specific hypothesis (1 aim: testing) and model validation (1 aim)
Need computational multi-scale model (spatial or temporal scales)
Sc multi-omics (<-) or spatial on organoid models
Spatial (molecules -> cells -> organoids -> patients)
"Role of neuroinflamation in (hallmarks of) aging"
Organoids from patient samples at multiple ages
patients: 4 groups of 4: fetal, young, old, old+AD
Does neuroinflammation accelerate aging and neurodegeneration?
Some organoids will have induced neuroinflamation
Predict relationship between inflammation and aging/AD (genetic clock - real age)
Use normal samples to build aging clock/genetic age
Then predict genetic age of inflammation/AD samples
Build separate models for different hallmarks of aging
"Preliminary results" can be simulated or examples from methods paper
April will handle epigenetic clock
Yanhong will handle biology

*** Write a few paragraphs and send to Yanhong to make into specific aims
