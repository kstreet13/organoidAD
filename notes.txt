==========
April Shu, Yanhong Shi (City of Hope)

RFA from NIH multiscale modeling 
2-3 levels: 1 is reprogrammed cells in dish to model Alzheimers
imaging(?) of brain organoids to connect to phenotypes
~ neural connectivity measurements
need spatial scale and temporal scale
April can do some analysis with epigenetic aging clocks
altered intercellular communication with aging
have organoids and mouse models

aging clock - bulk, tissue level?
cellular senescence(?) - cellular level
inflammation - tissue level? single-cell level as gene panel
intercellular communication - tissue level

secretome analysis (secreted proteins) - tissue level

Q: how do old/young glia cells influence old/young neurons?

scATAC? spatial? scRNAseq? (sc?)methylation?

want to use public datasets, but are there many on human brain? Yanhong: none on age-associated brain ogranoids

Identify markers related to aging and AD risk?
Q: find contribution of aging to neurodegeneration

Yanhong: main data will be scRNA+ATAC-seq

Yanhong will send email to program officer, we will draft some questions to ask and then meet with them.

----------
Yanhong Shi, April Shu
Deadline: June 13th
Alzheimer's disease brain organoids
Program officer wants a specific aims page
Need specific hypothesis (1 aim: testing) and model validation (1 aim)
Need computational multi-scale model (spatial or temporal scales)
Sc multi-omics (<-) or spatial on organoid models
Spatial (molecules -> cells -> organoids -> patients)
"Role of neuroinflamation in (hallmarks of) aging"
Organoids from patient samples at multiple ages
patients: 4 groups of 4: fetal, young, old, old+AD
Does neuroinflammation accelerate aging and neurodegeneration?
Some organoids will have induced neuroinflamation
Predict relationship between inflammation and aging/AD (genetic clock - real age)
Use normal samples to build aging clock/genetic age
Then predict genetic age of inflammation/AD samples
Build separate models for different hallmarks of aging
"Preliminary results" can be simulated or examples from methods paper
April will handle epigenetic clock
Yanhong will handle biology

*** Write a few paragraphs and send to Yanhong to make into specific aims
